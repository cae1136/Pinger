# Pinger
Pinger (currently v2) is a small batch file designed to enable a less experienced computer user to generate a file with their network configuration so that a support technician can diagnose network configuration issues.

### Planned Updates
* Add the ability to change ping target
* Make results.txt include more information (ie. Date, Time, User, Computer Name...)
